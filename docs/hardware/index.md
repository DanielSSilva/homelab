# Hardware Overview

This section documents the physical hardware components that make up my homelab.

## Hardware Components

My homelab setup consists of:

- **Mac Mini M4** - A compact yet powerful Apple device serving as a development machine and running macOS-specific services
- **Custom Server** - A self-built server handling the majority of my homelab services and storage

Each hardware component is documented in detail in its own section, including specifications, configuration, and specific use cases within my homelab environment.
