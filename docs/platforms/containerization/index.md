# Containerization Platforms

This section covers the container technologies used in my homelab environment.

## Container Platforms

My homelab uses the following containerization platforms:

- **Docker** - The primary container runtime used for most services
- **Colima** - A container runtime for macOS that provides Docker compatibility

## Container Management

For managing containers, I use:

- Docker Compose for defining multi-container applications
- Various management UIs for monitoring and administration

## Container Organization

My containers are organized following these principles:

- Similar services grouped in the same Docker network
- Persistent data stored in well-defined volumes
- Environment variables managed through appropriate configuration files
- Container health monitoring integrated into my monitoring system
