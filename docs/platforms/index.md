# Platforms Overview

This section documents the platform technologies that form the foundation for running services in my homelab environment.

## Platform Types

My homelab uses several key platform technologies:

- **Virtualization** - Virtual machine platforms for isolating entire operating systems
- **Containerization** - Container technologies for lightweight, portable service deployment

## Platform Selection Criteria

When selecting platforms for my homelab, I consider:

- Resource efficiency and overhead
- Management complexity
- Integration with existing tools
- Community support and documentation
- Security considerations
