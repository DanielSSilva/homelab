# 🏠 Welcome to My Homelab docs!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal homelab documentation site — the place where I aim to catalog and detail all aspects of my homelab setup. From hardware to services and containers, everything I use is documented right here!

This site primarily serves as my personal reference, helping me keep track of configurations, setups, and tips. However, since I love to share and talk about tech, I decided that this might help others as well.

# 🖥️ Why I Created This Site

There are many times that I'm chatting with friends or fellow tech/selfhosted enthusiasts and I get questioned about something regarding my homelab. For that reason, I've decided to compile all this information into one easily accessible place. Now, whenever someone asks me, "Hey, how'd you set up your Home Assistant?" or "What hardware do you recommend?", I can simply point them right here!

## Things that I aim to cover

- 🛠 Hardware – What do I use as servers, NAS, networking gear, smart home devices, and more.
- 🐳 Containers & Virtualization – Containers, Unraid, VMs, etc
- 🛎️ Services & Tools – A detailed list of services and tools that I use or have explored, ranging from pruductivity, to automation and everything in between.
